# Grocer
Helpful toolkits for your MRI data processing!


Welcome to use <Grocer> toolbox.
This toolbox contains many kinds of kits that you may be interested in during fMRI data analysis. These kits have been separated into many pull-down menus (So far, 9 menus) as above. 
This toolbox is a homebrew tool that I wrote during my own whole years’ experience on ASL (arterial spin labeling)-based CBF (Cerebral Blood Flow) data analysis. However, this toolbox is also compatible with BOLD data analysis. Just as its name says, Grocer, everyone should find something useful for their own data analysis!
This toolbox is run and tested on SPM8 with MATLAB 7.6.0(R2008a) under the Linux OS. Theoretically, most of the functions (except the menu1 & 2 which are specially designed for the Batch Editor of SPM8) of this toolbox should be compatible with SPM5 and should also work smoothly under the Windows OS.
Since its birth, it has been published for quite a few versions. Now it should be very stable now. However, along with update from time to time, it may always have some bugs that haven’t been checked out. If you encounter some bugs or have any suggestions during utilizing these kits, please feel free to contact me via e-mail: zshtom@gmail.com/zshtom@163.com.

fMRI Grocer has been distributed online for free. You can download it from both of the SPM and NITRC (Neuroimaging Tools and Resources) websites. The links are as below.
