==============================

Please always download the latest version!
Caution: Delete the old versions when you try to use the latest version!

The quick help of Grocer can be found in Menu 10: "About... --> Quick start" in the toolbox

1. This toolbox is a homebrew kits built during practical ASL(arterial spin labeling) based CBF(Cerebral Blood Flow) data analysis. Meanwhile, this toolbox is also compatible with BOLD data analysis. Just as its name says, it is a Grocer, everyone would find something useful for their own data analysis!

2. This toolbox is run and tested on SPM8 with MATLAB 7.6.0(R2008a) under the Linux OS.

3. Theoretically, most of the functions (except the menu1&2 which are specially designed for the Batch Editor of SPM8) of this toolbox should be compatible with SPM5 and should also work smoothly under the Windows OS.


Enter ¡°grocer¡± OR ¡°fmrigrocer¡± OR ¡°fmri_grocer¡± in the MATLB Command window to start the toolbox!
